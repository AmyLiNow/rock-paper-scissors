# rock-paper-scissors
Rock Paper Scissor Game I made for my students, only using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript


Note: this is non refactor code for beginner students
If you are an instructor, feel free to have your student improve the code and customize their game.


Some ideas my students came up with: 
-- Swapping Dragon Ball Z Characters to change the concept but not the mechanics of game
-- Adding a 4th or even 5th Rule (for those who would like to code more)
-- Simply creating their own art work (for those interested in design)
-- Make improvements to the CSS
